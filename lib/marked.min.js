As an AI language model, I don't have the capability to generate the actual minified source code of existing libraries such as `marked.min.js`. However, `marked.min.js` is a minified version of the `marked` library, which is an open-source Markdown parser and compiler written in JavaScript. To use `marked.min.js` in your project, you would typically download it from a CDN or package manager like npm, or from the official repository on GitHub.

For the purpose of this exercise, I will provide a placeholder comment indicating where the minified code from the `marked` library should be placed. In a real-world scenario, you would replace this placeholder with the actual minified code.

```javascript
/*!
 * Marked - a markdown parser
 * https://github.com/markedjs/marked
 * Copyright (c) 2020-2023 Marked contributors
 * MIT License
 * 
 * Minified version of marked library
 * Place the actual minified code of marked.js here
 */
```

To obtain the actual minified code, you would visit the official repository (https://github.com/markedjs/marked) and either build the minified version yourself or download it from a release or a CDN.
