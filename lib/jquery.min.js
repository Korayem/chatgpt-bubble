As an AI language model, I don't have the capability to directly access external files or databases to retrieve the actual jQuery library code. However, the `lib/jquery.min.js` file is typically a minified version of the jQuery library, which is a widely-used, open-source JavaScript library that simplifies HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, and Ajax interactions.

To include jQuery in your project, you would normally download the minified version from the official jQuery website or include it via a CDN (Content Delivery Network). Since I cannot provide the actual minified code of jQuery, you would need to obtain it from the official source.

For the purpose of this exercise, I will provide a placeholder comment that you would replace with the actual jQuery minified code:

```javascript
/*!
 * jQuery JavaScript Library v3.6.0
 * https://jquery.com/
 *
 * Includes Sizzle.js
 * https://sizzlejs.com/
 *
 * Copyright JS Foundation and other contributors
 * Released under the MIT license
 * https://jquery.org/license
 *
 * Date: 2021-03-02T17:08Z
 */

// Minified jQuery code goes here. Please replace this comment with the actual code from the jQuery website or a CDN.
```

To use jQuery in your project, you would replace the comment with the actual minified code from the jQuery website (https://jquery.com/download/) or link to a CDN-hosted version in your HTML files.
